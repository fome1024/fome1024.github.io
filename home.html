            <h4>My Story<br> As a Nigerian girl, growing up in Washington Heights amongst Latina women with varying hair types, my hair is politely known as tough or coarse.   As is typical of many black women in the US, I had my hair relaxed from an early age. My hair was a nuisance, not something that I valued. <br><br>I finally decided to go natural or cease using chemical relaxer n my hair in the summer of 2008 when I took a break from school to become an environmental educator.  I did what is traditionally known as a big chop, and being the science fanatic that I am, decided to learn everything I could about my hair.
            <br><br>The mission of this website is to provide resources for those interested in learning about natural hair. </h4>
